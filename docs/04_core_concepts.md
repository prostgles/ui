After installation and initial setup, you will see main Prostgles UI interface where you can add and open connections.

## Connections

A connection represents a unique postgres database instance (unique host, port, user and database name). Connections are grouped together based on host, port, and user to make it easier to distinguish access rights.

## Dashboard

Clicking or creating a connection will take you to the dashboard page.
Here is where most of the database interactions will take place through the available components: SQL Editor, Table, Map, Schema Diagram, AI Assistant, etc.

## Workspace

All significant interactions within the dashboard are saved to a workspace.
This allows you to organise your tasks and workflows.

## Top Navigation Bar

The top navigation bar provides quick access to all major sections of Prostgles UI.
Located at the top of the interface, it allows you to switch between database connections, manage users and server settings, and access your account preferences.
