After installation and initial setup, you will see main Prostgles UI interface where you can add and open connections.

## Connection

A connection represents a unique postgres database instance (unique host, port, user and database name).

## Dashboard

Clicking a connection will take you to the dashboard page where you can explore and interact with the database throught 
the available views like SQL Editor, Table, Map, Schema Diagram, AI Assistant, and more.

## Workspace

The views you open in the dashboard are saved automatically to the current workspace.
This allows you to return to the same views later, even after closing the application.

## Top Navigation Bar

The top navigation bar provides quick access to all major sections of Prostgles UI. 
Located at the top of the interface, it allows you to switch between database connections, manage users and server settings, and access your account preferences.
